In order to run our program, you must first compile the source code. To do so, run
    javac *.java

Once completed, to run the program, type
    java prog3

From there you can manually do the memory allocation commands.
If you want to redirect a file to standard input, just do as follows
    java prog3 < /path/to/file/that/you.want

Thank you!
